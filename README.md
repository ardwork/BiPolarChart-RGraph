<h2>Qlik Sense BiPolar Bar Chart</h2>
An interesting visualisation to compare two measures for values in a dimension. In the example provided I compare the sales mix vs the Orders mix.

<h3>Includes a 3d option</h3>

<h3>However, it's not perfect just yet...</h3>
<h3>Known Limitations and points to think about when using:</h3>
<ul><li>If you have more than 10 dimension values, consider using the limit dimension option to show the top 10 and others. This will ensure the bars do not become unreadable as the scroll bar does not appear in this version.</li>
<li>The scale is fixed for both axes so the values in both measures should be providing similar types of values.</li>
<li>On click selection has been disabled in this version. This will be worked on.</li>
</ul>
